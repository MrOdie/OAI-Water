      <h2 class="page-title">Development of Groundwater Resources</h2>
      <p>The development of groundwater resources depends on several factors among them, the intended use of the groundwater, the volume needed, the quality required and any permitting issues that may be required. These factors guide the planning and development of groundwater resources. Whether the groundwater produced is needed for irrigation purposes, industrial supply purposes or drinking water purposes, each case being unique, development options are similar.</p>
      <p>In this section, we will look at OAI's groundwater development projects for industrial, irrigation and public supply purposes. Included in these options is the development of single well projects, multi-well projects, single aquifer projects and multi-aquifer projects. Each of these cases are linked to on the tabs at the top of the page.</p>
      <p>Mobile County Water, Sewer and Fire Protection Authority's Boykin Road Wells is the first well sited by OAI for the water system. The hydrogeology was completed by OAI's Dan O'Donnell and was included in MCW's Wellhead Protection Plan Dan completed for the system. The well tested out at 1,900 gpm and was permitted for 1,000 gpm. Ten years on the <a href="files/boykin-well.pdf" target="_blank">Boykin Road Well</a> continues to be the system's best well both production and water wise.</p>
